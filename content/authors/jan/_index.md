He obtained his PhD in 2006 and is since 2016 tenure track professor at the Laboratory of Wood Technology (UGent-Woodlab) in the research domain of sustainable primary production. His main research interest is  the climate â€“ xylem growth relation at multiple temporal and spatial scales. He is and has been involved in several research projects dealing with imaging and analysis of wood and tree growth of which the TOCOWO (BRAIN B2/191/P2/TOCOWO, 2020-2022) project and the Afrormosia (UGent BOF-DOS, Chadrack Kafuti, 2019-2022) PhD project are most related to this proposal.  He has a pioneering role in the ongoing development of a (globally) unique X-ray CT-based tool-chain for the analysis of increment cores and micro-cores of trees, is member of the board of UGCT, a centre of expertise for CT scanning at UGent, and has a longstanding collaboration with the RMCA on tree performance studies in the tropics. He is member of the Scientific Committee of IRG and member of ATR.
