Dr. Ewango holds a doctoral degree from the University of Wageningen. His work focussed on the ecology of lianas in DR Congo and tropical tree biodiversity. He was responsible for the Okapi Faunal Reserve's botany program in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1996 to 2003. For his conservation efforts he received numerous awards, among others the Future of Nature Award (2011) and the Goldman Environmental Prize (2005). Furthermore, his work was instrumental to the creation of the Flore dâ€™Afrique Centrale, as proposed to be made accessible by API in COBADID.
