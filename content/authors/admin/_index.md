Dr. Hans Beeckman holds a PhD on the numerical analysis of tree-ring data. He is senior scientist and curator of the Xylarium at the Royal Museum for Central Africa and head of the Wood Biology Service. The xylarium is the largest wood collection of tropical African species outside of DR Congo and forms the source of data on wood traits stored in the Inside Wood database. Dr. Beeckman also curates the Tervuren Wood database, cataloging these samples. The Service studies the material wood as part of living beings. This includes the analysis of cells and tissues (wood anatomy) and the growth of trees with  most focus on the rainforests of Central Africa. His current research includes studies of the dynamics of cambial activity, the climate information in growth-ring patterns and the variability of wood traits. Furthermore, he addresses scientific questions on forest history (species diversity) and archaeobotany are addressed through analysis of charcoal containing layers in the soil (pedoanthracology). Through courses and identification services he has extensive contacts with the timber industries which will assist in dissemination of the data within the context of sustainable forest management.
