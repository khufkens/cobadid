Dr. Sofie Meeus holds a PhD in evolutionary biology from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven). After obtaining her PhD in 2014 she continued her research career at Stirling University (UK) as a PLANT FELLOW (Marie Curie COFUND programme) postdoctoral researcher studying polyploidization as a speciation mechanism. Since 2017, she has been working as a research scientist and coordinator of the COBECORE project at Meise Botanic Garden. During the course of this project she worked intensively with the African herbarium collection at MeiseBG, developed a full workflow for digitizing leaf functional traits including automatic detection of leaf structures using artificial intelligence and made the link with STEM education through the KIKS project that won the Queen Paola Award for Education 2020 (NL: Koningin Paolaprijs voor het onderwijs).
