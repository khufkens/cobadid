At the interface between ecological, sociological and economic research sits a need for quality controlled findable, accessible, linked and/or integrated long-term digital natural history heritage data to support retrospective or contemporary research across the Congo Basin.

We propose to link and integrate digital heritage collections centered around past century INEAC research efforts, making these data both findable, accessible and easier to valorize within both a scientific, policy or educational context.

We bring together the expertise of 5 partners overseeing large digital natural history collections, and their derived products, in a 4-year project to link these historical datasets while guaranteeing both data quality and covering various needs within the larger research communities. Our objectives follow a tiered structure, delivering both data and infrastructure solutions (APIs) along an asynchronous work schedule to maximizing project efforts.
