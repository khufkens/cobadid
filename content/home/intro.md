At the interface between ecological, sociological and economic research, education and policy sits a need for quality controlled accessible and integrated long-term digital natural history heritage data.

We bring together the expertise of five partners overseeing large digital natural history collections, and their derived products, in a 4-year project to link and integrate these data centered around past century INEAC research efforts. As such, making these data both findable, accessible and easier to valorize. 

Our methods will follow a tiered structure, delivering both data and infrastructure solutions (APIs) along with stand-alone data products in an asynchronous work schedule to maximizing project efforts.
